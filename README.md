# Literature Review – Using AI to Mitigate Railway Disruption in the UK

**MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**  
**University of Liverpool**

This repository contains a literature review submitted as part of the MSc in Data Science and AI at the University of Liverpool. The review investigates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mitigate railway disruptions in the United Kingdom.

## Overview

Railway delays in the UK—caused by infrastructural failures, environmental factors, and human-related issues—pose significant challenges to service reliability and passenger satisfaction.  
This review explores how AI and machine learning methods are being used to predict, prevent, and manage such disruptions. It evaluates their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for large-scale deployment.

## Contributors

This literature review was completed as a group project for the MSc in Data Science and AI at the University of Liverpool. The following students contributed to the research, writing, and analysis:

- Choudhury, Devarshi
- Lee, Jiwon
- Nwabuoku, Michael
- Pavlou, Lucas
- Proffitt, Fia
- Uh, Jintaek
- Wijesinghe, Prathusha
- Yiu, Benjamin

## Topics Covered

- AI for signal failure and track point prediction
- Predictive maintenance using CNNs and sensor integration
- Forecasting rail temperature and weather impacts using models like CLF-NET and CNU RTPM
- Human error mitigation using Conv-LSTM and BBI-GPR
- Use of deep learning (CNN, LSTM, GRU), ensemble models (XGBoost), and hybrid methods
- Challenges in scaling, real-time inference, and sociotechnical integration

## Methodology

- Conducted systematic literature search from October–November 2024
- Reviewed academic databases (Google Scholar, Emerald, Springer)
- Filtered for peer-reviewed papers from 2020 onwards
- Thematically organised findings into three main causes of rail disruption: technical, natural, and human
- Evaluated the accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability of various AI models
